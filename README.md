Figure out how to reproduce diagram here:

In functions.py one finds several classes to record each note played by a violin (or any instrument) with which one can anlyse the auditory profile, there is also a song measure and note class to construct melodies and compare how it is supposed to approximately sound on the specific instrument

Interpolation between notes is to be added for the violin class

accuracy of notes will also be added by controling the violin input notes

scaling profiles for differing violins is to be added to recognize qualitative differences
